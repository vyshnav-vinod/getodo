ONLY START THIS AFTER FINISHING TESTS



Allow a config file from users
	or
Prebuilt config file

Store settings/configs like
	- ignored paths
	- custom filetypes
	- colors change
	- name of default file to output i.e. name of todo.txt


Ask users in a questionary manner but to do not import libraries like questionary, it will just increase the bloat.. simple question asking will be enough
